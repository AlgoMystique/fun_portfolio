# just for fun/a passion project

I created this portfolio website for fun using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It's fully responsive and designed to look great on all devices.
I played around with hover effects to add some interactive elements throughout the site 
and incorporated a background video to make it visually engaging. 
I've also used box icons to give it a clean and modern look.
